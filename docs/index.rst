Python bindings to the Rackspace Cloud Servers API
==================================================

This is a client for Rackspace's Cloud Servers API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<api>` (the :mod:`cloudservers` module), and a :doc:`command-line script
<shell>` (installed as :program:`cloudservers`). Each implements 100% of the
Rackspace Cloud Servers API.

    You'll also probably want to read `Rackspace's API guide`__ (PDF) -- the
    first bit, at least -- to get an idea of the concepts. Rackspace is doing
    the cloud hosting thing a bit differently from Amazon, and if you get the
    concepts this library should make more sense.
